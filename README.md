# Crocodile-Name-Prediction

🐊 Crocodile Species Prediction using Machine Learning
This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts the species of crocodiles based on various features such as size, habitat, and physical attributes. Leveraging state-of-the-art algorithms, the project demonstrates how data-driven models can be applied to wildlife classification and biodiversity research.

✨ Features
📊 Cleaned and well-structured dataset of crocodile species
🤖 Multiple machine learning models tested (Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
🎯 Performance evaluation with metrics like Accuracy, Classification Report, and Confusion Matrix
📈 Visualizations for insights into model performance and species distribution
🔎 Easy-to-use pipeline for training, testing, and predicting species

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 🐍
scikit-learn
Pandas & NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn

🌍 Why This Project?
Understanding species classification helps conservationists and researchers in preserving crocodile biodiversity. By applying machine learning to ecological datasets, this project showcases how AI can contribute to environmental science. In this case, for learning about machine learning in general. feel free to use as an example 🙂
